# üåä Comprehensive Development Roadmap for OceanGuard Platform  
*Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting and Social Media Analytics*

---

## üìã Project Overview  
**Platform Name:** OceanGuard (CoastWatch AI)  
**Problem Statement ID:** SIH25039  
**Target Audience:** INCOIS, Coastal Communities, Disaster Management Authorities  
**Project Timeline:** 12-16 weeks (MVP in 4-6 weeks)  

---

## üéØ Phase 1: Foundation & MVP (Weeks 1-6)  

### Week 1-2: Project Setup & Architecture  
- Setup development environments:  
  - Frontend: React PWA, React Native (or Expo) mobile app  
  - Backend: Node.js/Express REST APIs  
  - Database: MongoDB for flexible data + PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial queries  
  - Storage: AWS S3 for media files  
  - Maps: Leaflet + OpenStreetMap with coastal overlays  
- Define core database schemas for users and hazard reports with geotagged locations and roles  

### Week 3-4: Core Features Development  
- **Authentication:** Aadhaar OTP integration for verified user registration  
- **Hazard Reporting Module:** Mobile app with camera, GPS tagging, voice recording, and offline support; multi-language capability  
- **Dashboard:** Interactive web map with real-time reports filtering by hazard type and time  

### Week 5-6: MVP Testing & Integration  
- Integrate INCOIS APIs if available  
- Setup SMS/Voice gateway for low-connectivity areas  
- Implement notification system and role-based access control for citizens, officials, and analysts  

---

## üöÄ Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-10)  

### Week 7-8: Social Media Analytics Engine  
- Aggregate posts from Twitter/X, Facebook, and YouTube via their APIs  
- Implement NLP pipelines using Python (spaCy, Hugging Face transformers) for text classification, sentiment and urgency detection  
- Stream and analyze real-time social media data related to ocean hazards  

### Week 9-10: AI Assistant & Advanced Analytics  
- Image analysis using Google Vision API or custom models for hazard detection in photos/videos  
- Perceptual hashing to detect duplicate reports within proximity/time windows  
- Generate dynamic geospatial hotspots using clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) for quick prioritization  

---

## ‚ö° Phase 3: Integration & Optimization (Weeks 11-14)  

### Week 11-12: INCOIS Integration  
- Integrate early warning feeds from INCOIS  
- Cross-validate citizen reports with official warnings for alert validation and enhanced decision support  

### Week 13-14: Performance Optimization  
- Real-time updates via WebSockets for dashboard and app  
- Cache frequent queries using Redis for faster response  
- Optimize backend queries and data indexing  

---

## üîß Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Weeks 15-16)  

### Week 15: Testing  
- Unit, integration, and load testing to ensure reliability and scalability  
- Beta testing with coastal volunteers for feedback on usability and offline sync  

### Week 16: Production Deployment  
- Deploy containerized (Docker) microservices architecture using Kubernetes or similar  
- Setup monitoring and logging for performance and errors (e.g., New Relic, DataDog)  

---

## üì± Mobile App Development  

- React Native or Expo for cross-platform mobile app  
- Offline support with data persistence via AsyncStorage or SQLite  
- Multi-language UI & voice input/output (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam)  
- Integration with backend for report submission, sync, and dashboard updates  

---

## üîê Security & Compliance  

- Aadhaar data hashed and stored securely per UIDAI guidelines  
- Anonymize location data to protect user privacy  
- Secure communication with HTTPS and token-based authentication  

---

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics Setup  

- API performance tracking and user engagement analytics  
- Metrics dashboard for monthly active users, report accuracy, response times  

---

## üéØ Success Metrics  

- API response < 2 seconds, uptime 99.9%, app launch < 3 seconds  
- 50,000+ active coastal users in year 1  
- 90%+ reports verified, reduce false alarms by 60%  
- 1000+ daily active citizen reporters, 50% faster emergency response  

---
